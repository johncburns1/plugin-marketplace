# Architecture Guide Skill

A conversational skill for creating high-level, one-page system architecture documents focused on patterns, trade-offs, and architectural decisions.

## What It Does

Guides you through creating an `ARCHITECTURE.md` file that documents:

- System requirements and capacity estimates
- Core entities and their relationships
- High-level design with diagrams
- Architectural patterns and trade-offs

## When to Use

Use this skill when you want to:

- Create an ARCHITECTURE.md file for your project
- Design system architecture for a new project
- Document high-level technical decisions
- Translate a PRODUCT.md into system architecture

## Output

Generates a one-page, technology-agnostic architecture document that focuses on patterns and trade-offs rather than implementation details.

Works best after creating a PRODUCT.md file (see product-definition-guide skill).

## Documentation

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the complete methodology and workflow.
